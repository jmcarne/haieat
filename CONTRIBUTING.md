##Tests

There's not a tests policy in the project at this moment, but it'll be greatly appreciated if you include them within the [updated test structure](./test/readme.md).

##Forks and Branches

All contributions must be submitted as a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) so you need to [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on your GitHub account.
The main branches are **`develop`** and **`master`**:

- **`develop`**: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**.  
**All PRs must be against `develop` branch to be considered**. This branch is developed using .NET Core 2.x
- **`master`**: Synced from time to time from **`develop`**. It contains "stable" code.  
(**Keep in mind "stable" does not mean PRODUCTION-READY!**)
